# 🔁 Lecture 14: Control Flow Statements in Python

---

## 🧠 What is Control Flow?

Control flow allows your program to **make decisions** and **repeat tasks** based on conditions.

There are **three main types** of control flow:

1. **Conditional Statements**
2. **Loops (Repetition)**
3. **Transfer Statements**

---

## ✅ Conditional Statements

These are used to execute code **based on a condition**.

### 1. `if` Statement
- Executes a block **only if** the condition is `True`.

### 2. `if-else` Statement
- Executes one block if the condition is `True`, and another if it’s `False`.

### 3. `if-elif-else` Statement
- Used when there are **multiple conditions**.
- Executes the block for the **first `True` condition**.

### 4. Nested `if`
- An `if` statement **inside another `if`**.
- Used for more complex decision making.

---

## 🔁 Loops (Brief Overview)

Will be discussed in more detail in upcoming lectures.

- `while` loop – repeats a block **while** a condition is true.
- `for` loop – used for **looping through items** (like lists, strings, etc.).

---

## ⛔ Transfer Statements (Coming Soon)

Used to **control the loop flow**:
- `break` – exits the loop
- `continue` – skips to the next iteration
- `pass` – does nothing (placeholder)

## 📝 Assignments from Lecture

### ✅ 1. Greatest Among Three Numbers (Less than 100)
Write a program that:
- Takes **three numbers** as input
- Checks they are **less than 100**
- Prints which one is **the greatest**

---

### ✅ 2. Divisibility Checker
Write a program that:
- Takes **three numbers**
- Checks if each is divisible by **2, 3, or 5**
- Prints appropriate messages for each

## 📌 Summary Table

| Control Type      | Description                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `if`             | Runs code if condition is true           |
| `if-else`        | Runs one block if true, another if false |
| `if-elif-else`   | Checks multiple conditions               |
| Nested `if`      | `if` inside another `if`                 |
