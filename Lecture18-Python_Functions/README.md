# Lecture 18: Python Functions

---

## 🔹 What You'll Learn

In this lecture, you explored:

* What a **function** is in Python.

* **Three types** of functions:

  1. Built-in Functions (`print()`, `len()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc.)
  2. User-defined Functions
  3. Lambda Functions (anonymous)

* Common built-in functions like:

  * `type()`, `isinstance()`, `round()`, `divmod()`, `any()`, `all()`, `pow()`

* Intro to functional programming with:

  * `filter()` + `lambda`
  * `map()` + `lambda`

## 📁 Code Files

### `main.py`

Demonstrates:

* Use of built-in functions with examples.
* Checking types with `isinstance()`.
* Applying `divmod()`, `any()`, `all()`, `pow()`.
* Getting input and processing with functions.
