### ‚úÖ **Problem Solving in Python**

Problem-solving is the process of analyzing a task and implementing a solution using Python. The key steps include:

1. Understanding the problem
2. Breaking it down into parts
3. Designing a solution (algorithm)
4. Implementing it in Python
5. Testing and debugging
6. Optimizing the code

### `main.py`

Demonstrates:

* Printing multiplication tables (static and user-input based)
* Checking even or odd number within a valid range
* Comparing two numbers to find the greater
* Identifying a day based on user character input
* Finding the smallest among three numbers

Each task is done using `input()`, `if-else`, and `for` loop techniques.
